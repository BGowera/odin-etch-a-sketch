# Etch-a-Sketch

An etch-a-sketch web app to practice DOM manipulation skills. Hover over the grid to "draw". Use the resize grid button to resize the drawing grid (size goes from a 1 x 1 grid up to a 100 x 100 grid). The eraser button will change the pen tool to an eraser. Use the color picker to set the pen color. Rainbow mode will draw using random RGB colors
